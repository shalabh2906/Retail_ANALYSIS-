R-Square data shows no predictability too with a poor value of .0014%. 
Hence Discount is not a suitable variable for regression analysis.*/

Shipping cost and Profit have a direct discernible relation here hence any one would suffice in predicting the variability with Total_Sales. 
Rest variables have good positive correlation with R^2 value boosted to over 88%*/

/*ï‚·1.  The R^2 88% IS VERY GOOD.
2. MEANS approximately 88% of the variation of Total_Sales is explained by the independent variables.
3. Based on t-test , the Pr-values for Quantity and Profit < 0.05 
indicating sufficient evidence for predicting the Total_Sales. 
4. This shows that increase in 1 quantity of product would raise the total sales by around $166 
and increase in profit by $1 would have meant sales would go up by $4.1.*/
